This code demonstrates a common JavaScript error stemming from loose typing and type coercion.  The `foo` function intends to add numbers, but due to JavaScript's implicit type conversion, when strings are involved, it performs string concatenation instead of numerical addition. This behavior can be very confusing and lead to unexpected results in larger applications. The solution shows how to explicitly check and handle different data types to prevent this issue.
